# bikeSOS

Small project to learn android development.

App to help cyclists find someone repair their bike when stranded

Todo:
- Familiarize with android studio and android SDK: whatever, good enough 30/09/2016
- Figure out push notifications with FCM: done 03/10/2016
- Figure out google maps API + geolocation
- Design a simple UI: started, I guess
